# Your diary, in your browser

## Read before use!

**Browser diary is in development, use it at your risk!**

You can try [last development version here](https://peaceful-wave-47443.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This is a small project to learn and study javascript, focused in build a diary in your browser.

## Features

Following list will change in future, but for now is aim for a full 1.0 version:

- [x] transform your browser in your diary: write and store your diary
- [x] your data, your content: your diary will not be stored online
- [x] focus on semplicity: clean and simple ui
- [x] ~~encryption: only you will access to your data~~ as simple experiment I've decided to simply hash diary entries
- [x] analyze your diary: ~~local analytics to help you visualize, learn and think using your diary~~ as simple experiment I've decided to do some simple analytics nothing fancy
 
## Principles

KISS and YAGNI as coding guidelines.
My aim is not to use latest version of any libray, but to create something useful for me.

## Postmortem

In order to proper conclude my experiment, I've decided to write down a small postmortem about this little project.

My goal was to study and practice with javascript I know well (old javascript, jquery, evil!) and not start with a new learning path with another framework. I want to test in my spare time if I'm able to design, plan and execute a small experiment. On this goal, I think this experiment was a success.


**Good**
- small and defined scope
- well organized with github projects, one for new features and one for bugfixes
- release often and early for quick feedback

**Not so well**
- project organization can be improved a LOT, but this a choice. I've put before features instead of project organization

**Bad**
- wasted a lot of time on crypto-stuff, forgot about YAGNI and try to convert this project with npm/webpack.

### Lesson learned:

1. start a project with a small, defined scope. So easy to throw new shiny things, but in the end your vision, if written down, will guid you
2. release on platform I can work quickly and free. Don't waste time to setup things, work on what I already know well. Ask for feedback!
3. focus on features, then project organization, libraries, build tools. You will have time later, when things will be more complicated
4. work with tools help you. I've switched in the middle of the project from Notepad++ to Visual Studio Code. So much easy to work with it

## What I can learn from this

First you can look into issues, project organization and commit histories.
Try to do same experiment by youself, using constraints: time and what you know now.
It's fun and you can learn a lot of things!
