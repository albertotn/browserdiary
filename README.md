## Description

This is a small project to learn and study javascript, focused in build a diary in your browser.

## Features

Following list will change in future, but for now is aim for a full 1.0 version:

- [x] transform your browser in your diary: write and store your diary
- [x] your data, your content: your diary will not be stored online
- [x] focus on semplicity: clean and simple ui
- [x] ~~encryption: only you will access to your data~~ as simple experiment I've decided to simply hash diary entries
- [x] analyze your diary: ~~local analytics to help you visualize, learn and think using your diary~~ as simple experiment I've decided to do some simple analytics nothing fancy
 
## Principles

KISS and YAGNI as coding guidelines.
My aim is not to use latest version of any libray, but to create something useful for me.
